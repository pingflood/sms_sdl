Known issues
=============

-  Fantastic Dizzy (Master System) : PAL Timings

Active Range should be 294 for PAL but it had to be set to 267 to make Dizzy work properly.
Unfortunately this is still not quite correct, we need a proper fix for it.

- LCD Persistence issues

Some games take advantage of the Game Gear's poor LCD screen.
If this behaviour is not replicated then it results in some heavy flickering.

Here's a list of affected games :
The Adventures of Batman & Robin (Disappearing HUD)
Super Monaco GP 2 (Titlescreen)
Space Harrier
Ninja Gaiden (affects 3rd & 2nd act)
Halley Wars
MLBPA Baseball

MAME has an implementation of LCD persistence here (first appeared in MESS 0.135) :

- Graphics Board

No support for it given how recent it is. MEKA supports this so i should take a look at it.

- Space Gun
http://www.smspower.org/Development/SpaceGun-SMS

I need to add back Lightgun emulation.
The code is left turned off for now because most games also support the controllers but this game requires the light gun.

There's also an issue with memory mapping. I believe we don't suffer from that bug ?

- Support for 4PAK Mapper
Mostly similar to Codemasters's writemap function except for 8000-0xBFFF range.

Write xx to 3FFE: map bank (xx)&maxbankmask to memory slot in 0000-3FFF region
Write yy to 7FFF: map bank (yy)&maxbankmask to memory slot in 4000-7FFF region
Write zz to BFFF: map bank ((xx&0x30)+(zz))&maxbankmask to memory slot in 8000-BFFF region

Problematic games (To be checked & tested)
=================================

-   Alibaba and 40 Thieves / Block Hole 
http://www.smspower.org/Development/AlibabaAnd40Thieves-SMS
Looks like it will need more research.

-  Bank Panic : R register
http://www.smspower.org/Development/BankPanic-SMS

I need to check if that's the case but there's so much we can do as we are already using the latest 
z80 core. (bar a few missing updates)

-  California Games II
http://www.smspower.org/Development/CaliforniaGamesII-SMS
Sonic's Edusoft had a similar issue with it expecting VDP Register 1 to be set to 0xE0, which is what the BIOS sets it to.

-  Dallyeora Pigu Wang
http://www.smspower.org/Development/DallyeoraPiguWang-SMS

Uses R register and Korean mapper. (Filesize is also not a power of 2)
Sounds like a problem.

-  Impossible Mission
http://www.smspower.org/Development/ImpossibleMission-SMS
Uses R register. 

-  James Pond 3 - Operation Starfi5h (Game Gear)
http://www.smspower.org/Development/JamesPond3-GG

-  Rainbow Islands
http://www.smspower.org/Development/RainbowIslands-SMS
Brazil release fixed this, perhaps we could patch the game on the fly ?
But that would be outside the scope of an emulator.

-  PGA Tour Golf

-  Zool : Ninja of the Nth Dimension
